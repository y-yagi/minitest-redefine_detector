[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/y-yagi/minitest-redefine_detector.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/y-yagi/minitest-redefine_detector)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/minitest-redefine_detector.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/minitest-redefine_detector)

`Minitest::RedefineDetector` makes an error if there is a redefined test.

If there is a test like the following, an error will occur at run test.

```ruby
class UserTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_name
    # ...
  end

  def test_email
    # ...
  end

  def test_name
    # ...
  end
end
```

```
user_test.rb:9:in `<class:UserTest>': 'UserTest#test_name' was redefined. (Minitest::RedefineDetector::RedefineError)
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'minitest-redefine_detector'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install minitest-redefine_detector

## Usage

Setting is unnecessary because it is loaded automatically.
